In my loneliness
            C6
When you're gone and I'm all by myself
           Em7         A7#5
And I need your caress
Dm7    Fm7      Bbmaj7
I just think of you
        Em7                        A7#5
And the thought of you holding me near
         Dm7                  G7#5
Makes my loneliness soon disappear

Though you're far away
I have only to close my eyes
And you are back to stay
I just close my eyes
And the sadness that missing you brings
Soon is gone and this heart of mine sings

Fmaj7 Fm7         Bb7
Yes I love you so
    Em7            Ebm7b5        Dm    G7#5
And that for me is all I need to know

I will wait for you
Til the sun falls from out of the sky
For what else can I do
I will wait for you meditating
How sweet life will be
When you come back to me
