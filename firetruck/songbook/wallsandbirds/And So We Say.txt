And So We Say
tom: C

    C                               Dm      
And so we say we wait for those how always lag behind
F       C
I don’t mind

And so we say we’re living up a day like any day
On the other hand a song but I don’t mind

And thou you say that all the words seem so easy to find
I don’t mind
