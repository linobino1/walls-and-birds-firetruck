G          F#                  Bm
Soaking up impressions where I roam
G              F#            Bm
Waiting for my lover here at dawn
G               F#                Bm
Waiting for the train to bring me home
G      D           F#                 G    D    F#
I must know please tell me where they go I must know

Digging for diffusion in your well
Looking back I see from where I fell
It’s not always that easy I can tell
I must know please tell me where they go I must know

I’m reading in my little book of poems
And I try to change the words and write a song
But I always fall asleep when its too long
I must know please tell me where they go I must know

Em               B        Am           B
And I nearly got mad with him & her in Annies Room
Em                 B        Am                 B
And it makes me so sad when she just said well see u soon
