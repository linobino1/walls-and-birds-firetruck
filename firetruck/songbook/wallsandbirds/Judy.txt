Judy came from anybody else 
But i dont know if shes the one for me right now

Judy says she thinks she falls apart
And that in that moment someone might see her heart

She also said she thinks she stays a few more days
If i wouldnt have it any other way

C            Bb
Just for one night
C          Bb     Am
I hold you tight
     Gm
Oh i might
