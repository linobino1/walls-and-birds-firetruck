Live In Malibu
tom: B

B                         G#m                   E       F#
In Janitors clothes in an empty building but my view is clear
B                        G#m                 G#m/F#
Streets get dizzy from a grieving feeling as if theres a death
   E                       F#            E 
to weep to but theres been no one living here in years

   B            G#m               E             F#     
Oh and when the questioning pauses for just ten minutes
B       G#m       G#m/F#       E    F#  E
I’ll be passed on to different kind of  feeling

Sighs come easy under sleeping ceilings
While I’m staying here
Dressed so nicely in my blueish workshirt as if I’m on sweeping
But there is no one to take care of here

And when the molding hallways shall be my deathbed
Take my keys and place them safely under the doormat

    F#                B       G#m
For when the time has come my love 
       E
You’ll find me
B                    G#m            E
Still on night watch gently waiting for thee
B           G#m           G#m/F#       E
You may not recognize the changes I’ve come through
B               G#m           E
Ghostly waiting for the day I see you
 B                 G#m        G#m/F#
Again and hear you steps as a parade 
           E
Across the colonnade
              Eb7               G#m
Uh baby I’m a ghost in janitors clothes
