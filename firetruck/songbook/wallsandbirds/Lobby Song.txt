The Lobby Song
tom: Am

Am                  C              Dm
From the car to the lobby up in my room alone
               Am              C
She called the lobby the lobby called me 
            Dm
I said that I`m not in what you are

             Am                   C
From where I am now to where he’s just been
             Dm
It’s just an inch or two I’m in his room
(I’s been a year or two since we last spoke)

Am
I grew up in the city 
C
Then I moved to town 
                        Dm
now I’m wonderingering around

Am
Ich wuchs auf in der Großstadt
C
Dann zog ich aufs land 
                     Dm
und jetzt lauf ich umher
