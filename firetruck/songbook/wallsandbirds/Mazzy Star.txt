About the love of mazzy star I was wrong
C#m                         Bm       A
Really tried to keep her from moving on

Thinking of a thing that stays stands alone
Really tried to hold her back but now sheâ€™s gone


G      F#m               D
And it all washed out of you
G        F#m       D 
Far from all the entanglements of our time
G      F#m               D
And it all washed out of you
G        F#m      D                G       A
Far from all the emptiness in your mind


Instrumental:
D   Bm    A   G   A   4x
