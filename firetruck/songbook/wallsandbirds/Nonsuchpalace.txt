Eb        Cm          Fm
Deep deep down in the great great hall
Eb             Cm                 Fm        Ab
There is a man standing quiet and tall tall.
Eb             Cm          
Dressed with a white dress right infant a white wall
Eb             Cm                 Fm        
There is a man standing quiet and tall. 


        Eb         Gm
When he moves it’s silence
         Eb          Gm
When his dress goes around him 
     Fm
It’s silence 


                Eb          Gm
So I got up and danced with him arm in arm 
         Eb             Gm                Fm           Ab
Come and seek where our voices sound they cannot sing above the ground
   Eb                Gm                    Fm                                          G7
Because we are under water and we are just looking for dead(that) bodies under(on the) ground. 


Eb
So long I’ve been watching you 
Ab                               Eb
Watching you do things I don’t believe 

   Eb
So sun sets over palace street 
Ab                            Eb
I forgot the place we used to meet.


       Abm         
As the man across the street goes:
  Eb      Gm               Fm                 Eb     Gm
I see and I feel your hand hardly touching my heart
       Abm                       Eb
As the water turns to hot for my skin 
  Gm                          Fm                Eb          D       Gm
I wonder where I was when the water was just as cold for my skin my day 
          Eb
Finds and abrupt end 
   D            Gm        Eb     Gm
My day finds an end as a tragedy 
  Eb         D             Gm
A tragedy so I go and take care


Eb                  Fm
I dont remember the name 
    Ab                              Eb
And I don’t think that he ever knew mine. 
Gm           Eb         Gm           Fm    Eb
He fills the air when I sleep at night I’m down. 


                    Eb
The fault is I’m am up I’m not down
       G
In the water I don’t drown 
        Ab                      Fm                        Eb
Can you tell me where I am on a scale from one to ten I’m down 
    Abm         Eb
We are down and down
   Abm                 Eb 
We are down but still awake.
