Lofiy I fear I hear 
F#m           E
Tremble in my ear 

And now the heat has gone
No sun hits the ground 

The harbors loner end 
We to loose our shift


C#m        F#m          Amaj7   Dmaj7
I wish the seasons would not so fast
(you me    euphoria)


I hear I hear my dear 
A way to keep me here

layein and always keep 
The boys on a leash 

No one did come or go 
They saw the rope before


I wish no further than something that lasts. 


No one did come or go 
They saw the rope before
