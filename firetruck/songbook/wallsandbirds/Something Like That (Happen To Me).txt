S4
tom: Gm

              Gm
I know of the vaults
    F
and bounds of the girl
(and bounds of the man)
        Gm        F
But you know what treats me most?

G     

         Am                  Gm        F          
And then time will come to a permanent stop
Dm              Gm
feeling somehow easy now
(Troublesome/Telephone times I just boroughed her tights)
Dm              Gm         F              Dm
waiting all my life to see something like that
(said I might be your lover but I need you right under my cover)

Dm        Eb    
happen to me
                     Eb7    D7
Gather now and turn around


                           
After havin come a certain length
I might consider absence as a chance
to redirect a please from a person
I have once been with on what people call a lake
it differs both in shape and in handling
