How I want you to know

That the play don’t always show

Dm
Come and write the words done you have ever set to me 
Dm
Words of texture words of past words of future funny words
Dm                                                    
And I’m saying what I’m saying but please stay here tonight
Dm                                                           Dm7/9
And you’re saying what you’re saying that your staying in my head

Come and write the words down we have ever laughed about
The words of mean things I remember words of you & me I see
And I`m playing that I`m crying and I`m singing right to me
But you don’t write back to me at least nothing I can read

As the bug says I love you more than you will ever understand
