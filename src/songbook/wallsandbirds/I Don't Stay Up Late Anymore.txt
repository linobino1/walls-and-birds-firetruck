Dmaj7   Cmaj7   Amaj7   Gmaj7   Dmaj7  x2

Gmaj7   Amaj7   Dmaj7                  x2


Dmaj7   Cmaj7      Gmaj7     Dmaj7      
I don’t play these games anymore
            Gmaj7     Amaj7   Dmaj7
Should have hooked me when it was
Dmaj7  Cmaj7   Gmaj7   Dmaj7
Just a part of everything
     Gmaj7           Amaj7                 Gmaj7   Dmaj7
In a place where the vision of her face is nothing more


I don’t stay up late anymore
I just spend my time
Writing words between the lines
Of everything I wrote before

She don’t stay up late
Things have just bend through
