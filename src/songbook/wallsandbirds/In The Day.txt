In the day 
                Dm7
I would sleep alone
     G
In a dream
             F   F9 F
Overhear the phone
             G
Now when she calls
                        Dm7    F
And says that she’ll be home
                C7             Am      G
By the time the snow begins to fall

            Am
Now on that day
                  Dm7
I would sleep for long
                G
In dreams she’s soiled 
                         F
The years must have been long
            G
I clean the tiles
                     F
The afternoon lights come

C               Am    Em   F      G
Theres a clean bed waiting for my lover
C             Am      
She & I had a falling out 
        Em                F        
But its not that we don’t get along

       Am                     Dm7
In the day we would speak for long
     G
Like tell me darling
              F
How was life abroad/at home
                G
It was quite alright / ok
                  F
The quiet days go one
           G
But now to you
                       F
Have you been with somebody
                 G
Yeah but not for long
(Oh no but never mind)
                   F
Her name I can’t recall
(Come here into my room)

Theres a clean bed waiting for my lover
She & I had a falling out 
But its not that we don’t get along
