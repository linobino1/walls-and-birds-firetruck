Leaving Home
tom: Dm


D                       G
What have I saved these pictures from
D                                               G
Must have let them in the rain and had a sunny afternoon


Dm                             Gm
Thats all I know about leaving home
Dm                            Gm
But where do they go with the quiet son
Dm                              Gm
I thought we had this thing here on the tracks
             F                          E7
I thought you know we leave (be) on our way


Leaving home is not a bad thing to do but
All I can tell is the books I’ve read from those I don’t
