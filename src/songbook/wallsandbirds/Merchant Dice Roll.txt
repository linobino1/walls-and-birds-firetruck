Merchant Dice Roll
tom: Dm

            Dm
Give it all off, the record no second thought
            F           F6     F 
It’s only a merchant dice roll
             Bb
You ought to know how they fall
            Dm
Give it all off
            Dm
Give it all up, the payroll no second thought
            F                F6  F
It’s only a week at the mall 
    F6         Bb
You surely can take after all 


Give her all up, stairs of course one last last chance
It’s only a weakening strawl
You should be glad its her fault


   F                   
Oh lone days maid be my carrier
  Gm                       Bb
I heard you talking in her sleep 


So long I’m in the willow tree 
Far better off than with she 

So long merging and rise and then bow
Until the other trees go 

Oh long side you in my parashoot
I heard you talking in your sleep


So long I’m in a threshing hold
Until the night is over 

So long merchants roll dice on my lawn 
imitiating women I’ve known

Oh don’t let them chop the willow tree 
I heard you talking in your sleep
