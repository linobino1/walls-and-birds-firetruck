Nothing At All
tom: Bm

Bm     C#m                 D
I have heard that theres a lady bird
Bm        C#m              G
And now I wonder what that is
Bm         C#m            D 
But I will fix her if she waits two days
Bm      C#m               G        A
Because thats how long it takes


Silent figures on a one way pass
Port didn’t aks her what that means
Didn’t tell her that its over soon
Because I don’t know how that feels

Shy reflections on the wall behind
Her chair and no one seems to care
See the lazyness between her eyes
And wish my hometown was right there

Bm      C#m         D
Oh mama look what I got
Bm C#m              D
Oh I got nothing at all
Bm      C#m               D
Oh mama look what she has got
Bm C#m                D
Oh she got nothing at all
Bm      C#m          D
Oh mama look what we got 
Bm C#m             G       A
Oh we got thing at all
