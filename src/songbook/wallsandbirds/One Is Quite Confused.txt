One Is Quite Confused
tom: C

C                        F
Head to head and face to face
       Em
How I failed to stay
C                  F
Our hands hold our hair 
    Em         Gm
And we see the other way
                   F
And the ones quite confused


All at once and after all
I don’t know if I would
But I will give & I will get
And I don’t know if you had
Other plans to be abused
