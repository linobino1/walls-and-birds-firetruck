Rain On The Parade
tom: Eb

        Eb                           Gm
Give us lazy days and fairytales and more than falling skys
        Eb                             Gm
Give us rain on the parade we walk and summer in the night

        Eb   Gm    
Give us lo - ve 
        Eb   Gm
Give me lo - ve


And give us thoughts to think in all the winter nights weâ€™re all alone
And give so much love we never dreamed of until we get it all
So much love yeah love

I swear I never dreamed until I met you 
I never dreamed of you until I met you
