Rita Breaks My Heart
tom: C


C                                      F
Ritas in a street cafe & she breaks my heart
         C              F
And so I tap her from behind
         C                 Fmaj7
And so I tap her uh in her red wine


Instrumental:
C  Dm  Am  Dm  
C  Dm  Am  


              Dm                             
Waiting until sun is raising above tomorrow

Through the yellow evening of the window train 
                                           C
Its more or less the same morrow stays the same

              Dm                             
Waiting until sun is raising above tomorrow

Through the yellow evening of the window train 
                                           Am
Its more or less the same morrow stays the same
