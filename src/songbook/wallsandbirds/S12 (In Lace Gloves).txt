tom: F

Intro:
F   Bb   Am   Dm

      F
Wide among
(your mistress called me from the hotel)
            Bb
A year not undecided
(she said she asked if you would mary me)
          Am
In ivory town
(turning back into the evening)
                Dm
Your gaze takes me places
(the swept green and lavender sky)
     Am
Sky shines
Dm                C
The upside down city

         
Takes me home
(Young rogue Dhalia remembered)
On a nice ocean liner
(that she caught the smile too)
Venice to Rome
(and before they knew they where together)
With you on my mind

Stray hair whisps
intimmeringly


Dm
Laughing quietly
   C          A7
To elevate my love

Bb                                  A7

(and I wouldn't know)

for annie and for me/ for any end for me
Bb              F                      F#m7b5  Gm
Take him to the valley autumn behind
Bb           Am9
I can go out wondering

But I
feel your sleeve to remind me
(she said she really plans to marry you)
how are we gonna tip the fortune
and devide it by three?
Leaving tonight like the large atlantig
before there where any kind of eyes to look at it

Dm                C     A7   Dm
I want a soft-end end

F   A
