Springtime
tom: Bbm


Bb            Dm
I will pay my debts 
           Eb             Bb
and in the Springtime go away
Bb           Bb/A         Eb
Tell me, my love, where to go
Bb               Dm
I will then be a way while 
       Eb            Bb
summer passes and in fall
               Eb
I'll come back to you
