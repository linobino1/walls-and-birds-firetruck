Eb         Eb/D        Fm
There on a brick brick wall
    Eb                             Eb/D    Fm 
All hidden with the leaves from an unknown plane (plant)
Eb
Waiting
Bb
Lay me down beneath the ruins


Where they can not see me then
Hiding with the leaves from the season fall
Waiting
Lay me down in front of you


Ab               Eb
The tapes that I stole 
         G              Ab        Eb
from the record store beside your door
Ab         Eb               Bb
I will not bring back bring back



Solo on verse


Bb
Lay me down in front of you


Gm                         F              Cm
Now every boy & girl under cover of their blanket
        Gm                                 F               Cm
See the lights surrounding them and all in all its quite romantic
        Gm                                  F                  Cm
But the robots in their pockets swept their Kisses stole their lockets
         Gm                          F              Cm
With the photographs inside of their very first own nighte


Gm     D         Cm
I will bury then widely in the open land 
Gm         D       Cm                 
no rage no fear no emptiness will demonstrate
     Eb             Ab
That when I draw my final will
    Eb                  Ab
with thick black ink on window sills
     Eb               Ab
Then you will have to shed no tear 
  Eb               Adim
because we had our really best time here
