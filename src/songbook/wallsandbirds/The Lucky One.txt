The Lucky One
tom: F

                            F
She said Iâ€™ll always be the lucky one
                             G
And shes the one that gets betrayed
                            F
She says the things I do are none like hers
                         G
And that is why she got away

I know the worst thing is my trembling mind
And not the things I do and say
And later on she sees the city lights
And wish she never got away
Yeah wish she never got away
