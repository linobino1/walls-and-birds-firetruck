The Three Words (She Said)

  F         C               D                Bb
I live in a square says the busy maid making phonecalls
      F            C                D           C
Where all the dead flies filled the bottom with rum
        F                 C       D             Bb
And the landlord is old & angry & sad cause his son died
       F          C         D               G    Gmaj7  G7  G6
at the age of eighteen everything goes on & on

The honor of contemplating about the loss of the young folks
In spaces where the ugly themselves do define
Is neither nor drastic or influenced by madness
    F              C              Bb           D       Dm

And I`m swimming on trees get away with me
       Ab          Bb         Eb
I take care of you too if you want
        Ab                    Abm
And the late cosmic spread is pretending to be black
       Bb                  Eb
As the day breaks I`ll be away
