Walls & Birds
tom: Cm


Cm                                   Gm
Seems like Walls & Birds have come between my plans
    Fm                          Cm
The color from the water so withdrawn
  Cm                                Gm
I wish I could record the rain that falls on me
   Fm                                Cm
Or paint just very thought of what I see


       Bb   Gm    Eb
Oh but they don’t know


Cm                                Gm
Leaves that shiver still upon the naked air
Fm                                 Cm
People shiver still from what they are
    Fm                             Gm
The softest sound today appears to loud for me
    Fm                         Cm
And I can’t be part of this at all


Cm                                  Eb
Lights & shackled winds is what you are
       Bb   Gm    Eb
Oh but they don’t know
