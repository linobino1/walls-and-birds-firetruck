Wearing A Dress
tom: Cm



  					           Cm
In springtime she would always wear a dress
                            Gm7/Eb
And I would always wear one two
Cm                                  Gm7/Eb
Of all the things I never dreamed I never dreamed
          Cm              Gm7/Eb
Iâ€™d be in love with you

Cm   Gm7/Eb
Cm   Gm7/Eb 

Cm
Though polly grew my heart still in the same
Gm7/Eb                 Cm    Gm7/Eb
Place where it used to be
Cm 
And now the view here is pretty different
      Gm7/Eb                  Cm  Gm7
In my mind the strangularity


Cm             Bb   Gm
Beeing in love with you

Cm   Gm7/Eb

Cm             Bb        Gm
Beeing in love with only you

Cm   Gm7/Eb


Gm                 (Cm)  Ab6
Maybe they make me leave again
                   Fm  Eb   C#maj7
Totally out of the question man
Gm                   (Cm)  Ab6
What if they make me leave again
                   Fm  Eb   C#maj7
Totally out of the question man
